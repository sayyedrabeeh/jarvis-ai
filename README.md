## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django web framework
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**:
  - `wikipedia`: Knowledge retrieval
  - `pywhatkit`: YouTube playback and web searches
  - `pyjokes`: Humor generation
  - `difflib`: Fuzzy text matching for better command recognition
  - `webbrowser`: Website navigation
  - `datetime`: Time and date functions

## 📋 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jarvis-ai.git
cd jarvis

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## 🔧 Usage

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser
2. Type your request in the chat input field
3. Interact with SmartChat using natural language commands:

```
"What time is it?"
"Tell me about Albert Einstein"
"Play Bohemian Rhapsody on Spotify"
"Open GitHub"
"Tell me a joke"
```

## 🧠 How It Works

SmartChat processes user input through a command interpretation pipeline:

1. **Command Recognition**: Identifies request type using fuzzy matching
2. **Intent Analysis**: Determines user's intended action
3. **Service Routing**: Selects appropriate backend service
4. **Response Generation**: Creates natural language responses
5. **Action Execution**: Performs requested tasks

## 🔄 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Serves the home page |
| `/process_command/` | POST | Processes user commands and returns responses |
